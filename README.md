## Overview
Welcome to the backend repository of the Crypto Price Analysis project! Here, you'll discover the server-side implementation of a system dedicated to analyzing historical crypto prices and delivering pertinent data through a RESTful API. Developed using Python and Flask, it employs a structured architecture with controllers and models utilizing Objectâ€“Relational Mapping. The deployment is seamlessly handled through Amazon Web Services (AWS). This readme comprehensively outlines the API endpoints and details the phases of structuring the database, development, and deployment. Feel free to explore the website and the backend server repository using the links provided below.

  ### 3. Testing
  ### 4. Security
  - Environment Variables
    - Ensure the security of your application by handling sensitive information through environment variables.
    - A crucial step is to create an `.env` file to store sensitive configuration details.
  - Sample .env Configuration
  ```dotenv
  DB_ENDPOINT="your_database_endpoint"

  DB_USERNAME="your_database_username"

  DB_PASSWORD="your_database_password"

  DB_NAME="your_database_name"

  GOOGLE_FILE_ID="your_google_file_id"

  CSV_FILE_FOLDER="your_csv_file_folder"
  ```
- Protect the Credentials
  - Never expose your .env file publicly or commit it to version control systems.
  - Add the .env file to the .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure.

## Deployment
  ### 1. AWS
  ### 2. Docker
  ### 3. Virtulenv
